# Demand Forecasting System for FMCG Retailer
## Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end demand forecasting solution built to address the inventory management challenges faced by a large offline retailer selling Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs). Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques (XGBoost) and historical sales data, this system accurately predicts future demand for each product category, ensuring optimal inventory levels and reducing the risk of overstocking and understocking. This project serves as a demonstration of proficiency in Python, SQL, and handling large datasetsâ€”critical skills for data science roles.

## Problem Statement
The retailer has been experiencing significant business losses due to inefficient inventory management, resulting in both overstocking and understocking of products. The key objective is to optimize inventory by predicting weekly demand for different product categories, enabling better alignment of supply with actual demand. This, in turn, will reduce storage costs, prevent lost sales, and improve overall profitability.
